# Contributing

This repo is maintained as a professional, operational AI governance portfolio — built for SMEs navigating the EU AI Act and broader data & AI governance.

## How to contribute

- **Feedback and suggestions** — open an [Issue](../../issues). I read everything.
- **Corrections** — if you spot an error in a controls mapping, framework reference, or regulatory citation, please open an Issue or submit a Pull Request.
- **Governance practitioners** — if you've implemented any of these frameworks in your organisation and have lessons learned, I'd welcome a conversation.

## What I'm not looking for

- AI-generated bulk PRs or SEO-driven content
- Academic rewrites of existing artefacts — this repo is intentionally operational, not theoretical
