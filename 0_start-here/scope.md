# Scope (SME-first)

## Who this is for
- SMEs (roughly <500 employees) adopting ML/GenAI or buying AI-enabled tools
- Product, engineering, data, security, compliance, and operations leaders who need practical governance

## What is included
- Governance for:
  - Internal AI systems (ML + GenAI)
  - Vendor AI embedded in business processes
- Artefacts that create an audit trail:
  - Intake, classification, risk register
  - Controls mapping and evidence packs
  - Documentation templates (model/system)
  - Monitoring, evaluation, incident response
  - Vendor due diligence and PoC planning

## What is excluded (for now)
- Legal advice or formal conformity assessment execution
- Sector-specific regimes (medical devices, aviation) unless explicitly added later
- Full ISO certification implementation

## SME assumptions (design constraints)
- Limited governance headcount
- Limited tooling (docs, spreadsheets, tickets)
- Governance must be lightweight and repeatable
- Controls must produce **evidence**, not bureaucracy

## Definitions (how terms are used here)
- **Provider:** the entity that develops a system/model and places it on the market or puts it into service
- **Deployer:** the entity that uses an AI system under its authority in a business process
- **Model vs System:**
  - Model = the statistical/LLM component
  - System = model + data flows + UI + human oversight + monitoring + processes

## Outcomes this OS optimises for
- Safe, reliable AI deployment
- EU-first regulatory readiness
- Auditability (evidence + traceability)
- Clear decision rights and accountability
- Faster adoption with fewer surprises
