# Scope (SME-first)

## Who this is for
- SMEs (roughly <500 employees) adopting ML/GenAI or buying AI-enabled tools

## What is included
- Internal ML/GenAI systems
- Vendor AI tools used in business processes
- Governance artefacts: intake, risk, documentation, monitoring, incidents, vendor eval

## What is excluded (for now)
- Full legal advice / formal conformity assessments
- Sector-specific deep dives (medical devices, aviation) unless explicitly added
- Full ISO certification implementation

## Assumptions
- Limited governance staff
- Minimal tooling (spreadsheets, docs, tickets)
- Need “minimum viable evidence”, not bureaucracy

## Definitions (how we use terms)
- Provider vs deployer
- Model vs system
- High-risk vs limited-risk (EU AI Act framing)

## Outcomes this OS optimises for
- Safety & reliability
- Legal/regulatory readiness (EU)
- Auditability (evidence)
- Repeatable decision-making
- Fast, safe adoption
