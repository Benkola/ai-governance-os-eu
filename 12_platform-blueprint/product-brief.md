# Product Brief — EvidencePack AI (EU)

## Problem
SMEs are under pressure to adopt AI quickly, but struggle to translate EU AI Act obligations into operational documentation and evidence.
Result: slow adoption, inconsistent controls, fragile audit trails, and unclear accountability.

## Who it is for (SME ICP)
- SMEs adopting GenAI/ML in customer ops, internal productivity, HR, and finance
- Roles: Product leaders, CTO/Head of Eng, Data lead, Security/Privacy, Risk/Compliance (where present)

## What it does (one sentence)
Converts an AI use case into an EU AI Act-ready **evidence pack** (intake, obligations, controls, documentation, monitoring, incident readiness) with an auditable approval trail.

## Jobs-to-be-done
- “I need to approve an AI use case safely and consistently.”
- “I need an evidence pack I can defend to leadership, auditors, or regulators.”
- “I need vendor AI governed with real obligations and monitoring commitments.”
- “I need repeatable governance that doesn’t require a full compliance team.”

## MVP scope (in)
- Intake → classification (risk tier hypothesis)
- EU obligations checklist + controls selection
- Evidence pack generation (templates filled with context)
- Approval log (who approved, when, what evidence)
- Export packs (board/procurement/regulator format)

## MVP scope (out)
- Full legal conformity assessment execution
- Deep sector-specific modules (health/aviation)
- Automated integrations (M365/Jira/Cloud logs) — later
- Benchmark datasets and scoring calibration — later

## Why now
- EU-first governance expectations are rising
- SMEs are adopting GenAI faster than their governance capability
- The bottleneck is not model building; it’s **operational evidence and accountability**

## Differentiation
- EU-first evidence pack generation (not generic policy templates)
- SME-implementable defaults (minimum viable controls + cadence)
- Audit trail as a first-class output
- “Implement once, speak EU + NIST” mapping

## Business model (v1)
- B2B subscription per org (tiers by number of systems)
- Optional onboarding workshop + implementation support
- Optional “vendor governance pack” add-on

## Risks/constraints
- Must avoid presenting as legal advice
- Must ensure outputs are transparent and reviewable (not black-box compliance)
- Must be usable with minimal tools and minimal governance headcount
