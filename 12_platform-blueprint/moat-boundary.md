# Scope & boundaries (public repo vs future platform)

## What this public repo contains
This repo publishes **governance artefacts** intended to be useful and recruiter-readable:
- Frameworks, controls maps, and checklists
- Operating model and RACI (how governance runs)
- Documentation templates (intake, risk register, model/system cards)
- Monitoring and incident response playbooks
- Case studies showing end-to-end application

## What the future platform will add (not published here)
A separate commercial implementation is planned privately, focused on:
- Workflow automation (intake → evidence pack → approvals → audit trail)
- Integrations (e.g., document systems, ticketing, cloud logs)
- Export packs for stakeholders (board/procurement/compliance)
- Benchmarking and continuous improvement signals derived from usage

## What is intentionally not published in this repo
To keep the public artefacts reusable while preserving a product roadmap, this repo excludes:
- Production automation logic and configuration rules
- Calibrated scoring weights, thresholds, or benchmarking datasets
- Customer-specific implementation playbooks or proprietary defaults
