# EU AI Act mapping

This section maps EU AI Act requirements to concrete governance artefacts and evidence.

## What lives here
- Practical interpretations of relevant EU AI Act articles
- Control and evidence mappings for AI systems
- Checklists to support governance reviews

## How this maps to evidence packs
Each requirement links to:
- A governance artefact (e.g. risk register, monitoring plan)
- Evidence produced through normal operations
- Decision records and ownership

## Why this matters
AI governance fails when regulation is treated as documentation instead of operations.
This section translates legal expectations into implementable governance controls.
