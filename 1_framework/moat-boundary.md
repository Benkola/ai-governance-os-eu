Acceptance criteria

explicitly lists what is public vs private

explicitly states what will never go in public repo (benchmarks, scoring weights, automation logic)

“Repo provides reference governance artefacts.”

“Commercial platform (automation + integrations + benchmarking) is separate.”

“This repo intentionally excludes operational automation logic and benchmark data.”
